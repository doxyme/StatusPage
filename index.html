        <span class="title">Widespread Internet Outage</span>
        <p>Today there was a massive DDoS attack against a central part of the internet infrastucture. Doxy.me was slightly affected with some users getting errors, or not being able to have a call. Most major sites have started to come back online, and it appears doxy.me is working as expected currently. Please report any further issues to: https://doxyme.freshdesk.com/support/solutions
