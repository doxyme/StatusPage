        <p>The website experienced ~10 minutes of degraded service today. Our scaling processes were slow to respond to higher demand than normal. We've since increase our resources and have future performance improvements over the next couple weeks.</p>

        <span class="title">Upstream Service Provider Issue</span>
        <p>We apologize for any inconvenience. It appears that one of our upstream services providers is having some issues. We are working with them to resolve the issue. Currently we do not have a good timeframe to when this will be resolved. But we will send out updates as they come in.</p>
        
        <p><em>Update 2016-11-11 01:28:40</em><br/>
          We have been notified that the service has returned to normal operation and will be monitored closely and will be marked resolved after the requisite observation period.

We apologize for any inconvenience.
